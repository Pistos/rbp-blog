h2. Jeremy McAnally

I'm a developer at <a href="http://entp.com/">entp</a>, and in my spare time, I write books (such as the <a href="http://humblelittlerubybook.com/">Humble Little Ruby Book</a> and <a href="http://manning.com/mcanally">Ruby in Practice</a>) and open source (such as <a href="http://github.com/jeremymcanally/foundry">foundry</a>, <a href="http://github.com/jeremymcanally/context">context</a>, <a href="http://github.com/jeremymcanally/matchy">matchy</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/jeremymcanally/">a ton of other stuff</a>).  When not doing all that, I typically lounge and indulge in a variety of scholarly hobbies, such as watching Looney Tunes, reading books on early American history, and "kicking it" with my wife and dogs.
