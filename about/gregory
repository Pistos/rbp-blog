h2. Gregory Brown

I'm the author of the O'Reilly book <a href="http://rubybestpractices.com">Ruby Best Practices</a> and a fairly crunchy person when it comes down to it. I took off half a year in 2008 to work on the PDF generation library "Prawn":http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com, supported by the "kindness of the Ruby community":http://majesticseacreature.com/mendicant. I live in New Haven, CT with my girlfriend, some small animals, and a bamboo plant that seems to live without water.

* Speaking at "GoRuCo":http://goruco.com May 30th, 2009

I can be found on Twitter as "@rubypractices":http://twitter.com/rubypractices and "@seacreature":http://twitter.com/seacreature .

I also run the "Majestic Sea Creature":http://majesticseacreature.com blog, and if you're really interested in stalking me, my non-technical writings are at "Meta-Metta":http://metametta.blogspot.com, which I swear I'll eventually dust off.
